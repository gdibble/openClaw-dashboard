## What Is This?

A real-time web dashboard that gives you eyes on your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.io) agent swarm. It reads task files directly from your swarm's task directory and presents everything in a clean, dark-themed UI.

**No database. No backend setup. Just point it at your tasks folder and go.**

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Agent Auto-Discovery** | Agents are detected from your task files automatically — no configuration needed |
| **Agent Strip** | See every agent's status and completion stats at a glance — who's working, who's idle |
| **Kanban Board** | Drag-and-drop tasks across lanes: In Progress, Review, Assigned, Waiting, Inbox, Done |
| **Live Feed** | Real-time activity stream from task changes, auto-refreshes every 30s |
| **Metrics Panel** | Charts and stats — task throughput, status distribution, per-agent workload breakdown |
| **Token Tracking** | Input/output token usage per task, model breakdown charts, daily trends |
| **Personalization** | Custom name, theme (dark/light), 8 accent colors, logo icon — persists across updates |
| **Welcome Screen** | Fresh installs get a guided onboarding with sample task format |
| **Update Checker** | Header shows when a new version is available on GitHub |
| **Command Palette** | `Cmd+K` to quickly filter agents, toggle feed, refresh data |
| **Task & Agent Modals** | Click any task or agent for full detail views with activity timelines |
| **Mobile Responsive** | Full mobile support — wrapping layouts, bottom-sheet modals, touch-friendly sizing |

## Why OpenClaw Dashboard?

### Zero friction
Drop JSON files in a folder. That's the entire backend. No database required, no config files to wrestle with, no Docker compose to debug. Point it at your tasks directory and you're live in under a minute.

### Works with any AI
Claude, GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Mistral, local models — it doesn't matter. The dashboard reads standard JSON. If your agent can write a file, it can talk to this dashboard. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary APIs.

### AI-assisted setup
Tell your AI agent to clone the repo and read `AGENTS.md`. It handles installation, asks you personalization questions (name, theme, colors), and writes a config file — all without you touching a terminal. Works with any AI agent.

### Your style, your brand
8 accent colors. Dark and light themes. 10 logo icons. Custom dashboard name and subtitle. Custom agent roster. All stored in a single `settings.json` that **survives every update** — `git pull` never touches your preferences.

### Token usage visibility
See exactly how many tokens each task consumed. Per-model breakdowns. Daily trend charts. Input vs output splits. Know where your API budget is going before the invoice arrives.

### Self-updating
The header shows when a new version is available on GitHub. Pull updates with a single `git pull` — your `settings.json` is gitignored, so your preferences are never overwritten.

### Production-ready security
API key authentication. Rate limiting (60 req/min per IP). Path traversal protection. File size limits. Sanitized error messages. Published security audits in the repo — nothing hidden.

### Built for teams
Bind to `0.0.0.0` and anyone on your network gets eyes on the swarm. Real-time agent status, live activity feed, Kanban board with drag-and-drop. Everyone sees the same picture.

### Lightweight and fast
Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS. No heavy ORM, no background workers, no message queues. Reads files from disk, serves JSON over HTTP. Runs comfortably on a $5/month VPS.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An OpenClaw swarm with a tasks directory (JSON files)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bokiko/openClaw-dashboard.git
cd openClaw-dashboard
npm install
```

### Configure your tasks path

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `OPENCLAW_TASKS_DIR` to your swarm's task directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and set OPENCLAW_TASKS_DIR
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Recommended: Agent-Assisted Install

For the best setup experience, let your AI agent handle the installation. Point any AI agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini, or others) at this repo and it will:

1. Clone and install dependencies
2. Ask you personalization questions (name, theme, accent color, logo)
3. Write a `settings.json` that persists across future updates
4. Configure environment variables
5. Start the server

The agent reads [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — a comprehensive setup guide written for AI agents of any capability level. Your preferences are stored in `settings.json` (gitignored), so `git pull` never overwrites them.

```
"Clone github.com/bokiko/openClaw-dashboard and set it up. Read AGENTS.md for instructions."
```

---

## Personalization

The dashboard is fully customizable via `settings.json` in the project root:

```bash
cp settings.example.json settings.json
# Edit settings.json with your preferences
```

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `name` | Any string | `"OpenClaw"` |
| `subtitle` | Any string | `"Mission Control"` |
| `theme` | `dark`, `light` | `dark` |
| `accentColor` | `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `orange`, `red`, `cyan`, `amber`, `pink` | `green` |
| `logoIcon` | `zap`, `brain`, `bot`, `flame`, `shield`, `rocket`, `sparkles`, `cpu`, `eye`, `activity` | `zap` |
| `cardDensity` | `compact`, `comfortable` | `comfortable` |
| `showMetricsPanel` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `showTokenPanel` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `timeDisplay` | `utc`, `local` | `utc` |

Settings are gitignored and survive updates. See [`settings.example.json`](settings.example.json) for the full schema.

---

## Configuration

The dashboard reads JSON task files from a single directory. Set the path via environment variable in `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENCLAW_TASKS_DIR=/path/to/your/tasks
```

If not set, it defaults to `./tasks` relative to the project root.

The dashboard will:
- Scan for all `.json` files in that directory
- Parse each file into a task with status, priority, assignee, and tags
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Skip files larger than 1MB and validate paths to prevent traversal

---

## Security

### API Key Authentication

For deployments beyond localhost, protect the API with a key:

```bash
# In .env.local
OPENCLAW_API_KEY=your-secret-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENCLAW_API_KEY=your-secret-key
```

When `OPENCLAW_API_KEY` is set, all requests to `/api/data` must include an `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header. If not set, the API remains open (suitable for local development).

### Rate Limiting

The API endpoint includes built-in rate limiting (60 requests per minute per IP). Requests exceeding the limit receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### Path Traversal Protection

Task file loading validates that all resolved file paths stay within the configured tasks directory, preventing directory traversal attacks.

---

## Task File Format

The dashboard is flexible with field names. Drop JSON files into your tasks directory:

```json
{
  "id": "task-001",
  "title": "Implement auth middleware",
  "description": "Add JWT validation to all API routes",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "priority": "high",
  "claimed_by": "spark",
  "tags": ["backend", "security"],
  "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Status mapping

The dashboard normalizes various status strings:

| Your value | Dashboard shows |
|------------|----------------|
| `complete`, `completed`, `done`, `approved` | Done |
| `in-progress`, `in_progress`, `active`, `working` | In Progress |
| `review`, `submitted`, `pending_review` | Review |
| `assigned`, `claimed` | Assigned |
| `waiting`, `blocked`, `paused` | Waiting |
| anything else | Inbox |

### Priority mapping

| Your value | Dashboard shows |
|------------|----------------|
| `urgent`, `p0`, `critical` | Urgent (red) |
| `high`, `p1` | High (amber) |
| anything else | Normal (grey) |

### Assignee detection

The dashboard checks these fields in order: `claimed_by` → `assignee` → first `deliverables[].assignee`.

---

## Agent Roster

Agents are **auto-discovered** from your task files. Any unique `claimed_by`, `assignee`, or `deliverables[].assignee` value becomes an agent in the dashboard — no configuration required.

Auto-discovered agents get:
- A capitalized name derived from their ID
- A color from a 10-color palette
- `working` status if they have an in-progress task, `idle` otherwise
- Completion stats (`done/total`) shown on the agent strip

To override with a custom roster, set the `agents` array in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "id": "spark", "name": "Spark", "letter": "S", "color": "#ffb224", "role": "Code & Writing", "badge": "spc" },
    { "id": "scout", "name": "Scout", "letter": "R", "color": "#3e63dd", "role": "Research" }
  ]
}
```

Settings agents take priority over auto-discovery when configured.

**Data flow:** Task JSON files on disk → `data.ts` reads them → `/api/data` serves them → `useSwarmData` hook fetches every 30s → React components render. Settings from `settings.json` are applied server-side and sent to the client via the API.

## Audit Reports

We build in the open. No security through obscurity, no hidden vulnerabilities, nothing to cover up. Every audit we run gets published right here in the repo — the findings, the fixes, and the reasoning behind them. If someone finds a flaw, we'd rather the world see how we handled it than pretend it never existed.

This is how trust gets built: not by claiming perfection, but by showing the work.

| Date | Report | Findings | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| 2026-02-08 | [Security Audit](audits/2026-02-08-security-audit.md) | 7 (1 critical, 2 medium, 4 low) | All remediated |
